          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
            Bayesian Regret is a method that can be used to evaluate voting
            systems. Utilities are assigned to every candidate for every voter
            in the simulation, and these utilities are used to a) construct
            voter profiles, and b) determine the total utility for every
            candidate if they win the election. These utilities can be assigned
            using spatial methods, wherein voters and candidates can be assigned
            position vectors where each element is a numerical representation of
            a person's stance on some issue, and utility is the Euclidean
            distance between voters and candidates. A 'magic winner' is
            determined, as some candidate whose position is such that the total
            utility is a maximum. Elections are run for various voting methods,
            and the utility is given by the winner; this number is then compared
            to the magic utility, and the difference between the two is the
            Bayesian Regret. Lots of elections (simulations) are run to find the
            average Bayesian Regret per voting system. To make this more
            informative, different voter behaviours can be involved.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
            For example, complete voter honesty where voter profiles are
            proportional to utility profiles, fully-strategic voting, one-sided
            strategic, two-sided strategic, or a mix. VSE (voter satisfaction
            efficiency) is slightly different to Bayesian regret: \[VSE(method)
            = 1 - {BR(method) \over BR(random winner)}\]

            Warren Smith and Jameson Quinn did lots of work in making these
            simulations. Their results are as follows (Smith's BR results, and
            Quinn's VSE results):

          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
            Quinn's simulation is a bit more recent and more sophisticated than
            Smith's; beyond more voting methods, and more voter behaviours, he
            also includes random noise in the conversion from utility profile to
            voter profile (because voters don't really know their exact
            positions, or candidates exact positions, and may have other
            biases). His utility generation method is also a bit more realistic.

            In doing non-trivial, I made a (very primitive) model to try and do
            this better, and found some areas where I think the model could be
            refined to be more informative:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              How many issues do voters actually take into account when making
              decisions?
            </li>
            <li>
              How should the position vector elements be generated? i.e.
              randomly, normally (with what parameters?) Should these elements
              be independent?
            </li>
            <li>
              What voter behaviours are the most common / what proportions do
              they occur in?
            </li>
            <li>
              Should random noise be added by drawing randomly from some given
              range, or using some distribution?
            </li>
